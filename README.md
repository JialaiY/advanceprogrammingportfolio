## Balloon Game
Protect the Balloon is a Java-based game using an object-oriented approach with classes like Main, Balloon, Obstacle, Projectile, and Button. The Main class manages the game loop, rendering, and input handling. The Balloon represents the playerâ€™s target, while Obstacle objects move toward it. The Button class handles UI interactions. The game utilizes Processing's built-in functions for graphics and event handling, with efficient collision detection and object management for smooth gameplay.
### Year Two Concepts
GUI, Inheritance, Exception Handling (try and catch block at start of game), Enhanced for loop (game loop)
