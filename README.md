The Main class manages the game loop, rendering, and input handling. The Balloon represents the playerâ€™s target, while Obstacle objects move toward it. The Button class handles UI interactions. The game utilizes Proessing for graphics and event handling, with efficient collision detection and object management for smooth gameplay.
