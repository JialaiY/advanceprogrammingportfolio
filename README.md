## Balloon Game
This game is a simple grid-based version of Whack-a-Mole built in the Processing IDE. The player is presented with a 5x5 grid where "moles" randomly appear as brown circles (TrashCell objects). The player must click on the moles to gain pointsâ€”each successful hit earns 10 points. After every click, the grid refreshes with a new random distribution of moles. The game uses a 30-second countdown, and the goal is to reach 200 points before time runs out. The code utilizes inheritance (with a Cell superclass and EmptyCell/TrashCell subclasses), 2D arrays to represent the grid, enhanced for loops to iterate through cells, exception handling to prevent runtime errors, and a simple GUI with buttons and score/time displays to manage the game's flow.
